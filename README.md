# Bloo
Complete Business Management

## Firebase Setup
Upon download, you will need to run `firebase init` to initialize Firebase to run Bloo.
While running the initialization, you will need to be sure to do the following:

* Select database, functions, hosting and storage and use able features. 
* Change the public directory to **app**
* Change the functions directory to **functions**

If you've never user Firebase before, be sure to follow the [getting started](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?authuser=0) guide on their website.

## Project Color Scheme
This is the default color scheme for this project. We will use this to create the base design for Bloo. Color Scheme was created with [coolors.co](http://www.coolors.co)
